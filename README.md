Collection of C++ controllers for torque-based control in ROS2. Tested on the Franka Robotics FR3 Robot.
Check the [docs](https://danielsanjosepro.github.io/crisp_controllers/)!

## ✨ Features ✨

- 🤖 Operational Space Controller as well as Joint Impedance Controller for torque-based control.  
- 🚫🧭 No MoveIt or complicated path-planning, just a simple C++ `ros2_controller`. Ready to use.  
- ⚙️🔧 Dynamically and highly parametrizable: powered by the `generate_parameter_library` you can modify stiffness and more during operation.  
- 🐍🕹️ Python interface to move your ROS2 robot around without having to think about topics, spinning, and more ROS2 jargon!
