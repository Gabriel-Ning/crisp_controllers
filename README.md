CRISP is a collection of real-time, C++ controllers for compliant torque-based control for manipulators compatible with `ros2_control`, including **Cartesian Impedance Control** and **Operational Space Control**. Developed for deploying high-level learning-based policies (VLA, Diffusion, ...) and teleoperation on your manipulator. It is robot-agnostic and compatible with any manipulator offering and effort interface. Check the [project website](https://utiasdsl.github.io/crisp_controllers/) for guides, getting started, demos and more! 

## Features

- ü§ñ Operational Space Controller as well as Cartesian Impedance Controller for torque-based control.  
- üö´ No MoveIt or complicated path-planning, just a simple C++ `ros2_controller`. Ready to use.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamically and highly parametrizable: powered by the `generate_parameter_library` you can modify stiffness and more during operation.  
- üêç Python interface to move your ROS2 robot around without having to think about topics, spinning, and more ROS2 concepts but without loosing the powerful ROS2 API. Check [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) for more information and examples.
- üîÅ Gym environment with utilities to record trajectories in LeRobotFormat and deploy trained policies. Check [crisp_gym](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_gym).
- ‚ùì Demos showcasing how to use the controller with FR3 of Franka Emika in single and bimanual setup. Check the [crisp_controller_demos](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_controllers_demos).
